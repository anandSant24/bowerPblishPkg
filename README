1. pushed the code changes to the repos

bower works off of the tag, so tag your project with same version as 0.0.1
and push again in repo by adding tags flag

2. $ git tag 0.0.1

3. $ git push --tags

now go to github and see that there is one release has been created click on that it shows 0.0.1 has been created

final step to create bower package is to register it
bower register <name of pkg> <url>/<username>/<name of repo>

Ex: 
$ bower register BowerPkgDemo https://github.com/anandSant24/bowerPblishPkg.git
bower resolve       https://github.com/anandSant24/bowerPblishPkg.git#*
bower checkout      BowerPkgDemo#0.0.1
bower invalid-meta  The "name" is recommended to be lowercase, can contain digits, dots, dashes
bower resolved      https://github.com/anandSant24/bowerPblishPkg.git#0.0.1
? Registering a package will make it installable via the registry (https://bower? Registering a package will make it installable via the registry (https://bower.herokuapp.com), continue? Yes
bower register      https://github.com/anandSant24/bowerPblishPkg.git

bower validate      0.0.1 against https://github.com/anandSant24/bowerPblishPkg.git#*
bower install       BowerPkgDemo#0.0.1

BowerPkgDemo#0.0.1 js\lib\BowerPkgDemo
